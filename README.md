# Create My Bin!

Creates ~/.bin directory (for your custom executable scripts)

It then fixes permissions and adds some useful scripts from the scripts directory most of which I use when setting up
default dev environments on OSX

### Install is Easy

Open Terminal, copy and paste the following:

git clone https://github.com/thewebsitenursery/createmybin.git && cd createmybin && sudo ./createmybin
